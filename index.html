    <h1>Find the Missing</h1>
    <p>Every year, thousands of people go missing across the world, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and heartbroken loved ones. In the United States, where going missing voluntarily is legally permissible, this phenomenon takes on a unique significance. When reporting a loved one as unreachable, law enforcement often highlights this possibility in the crucial first few hours, which are vital for any subsequent investigation. Sadly, there is no focused or unanimous effort from authorities to collect and store information in a centralized place where we can crowdsource our efforts to locate missing individuals.</p>
    <p>This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a collaborative platform where we can gather and share information about missing persons. By harnessing the power of crowdsourcing, we can collectively contribute our knowledge, insights, and any available details that could aid in the search for those who have gone missing.</p>
    <p>Please contribute by submitting your updates to the <em>missing_persons_clean.csv</em> file. Only submissions that include valid resource links for verification will be merged.</p>
    <p>Please explore the interactive map that visualizes the locations and key details of missing persons and let's make a difference!</p>
