# Let's find the missing

Every year, thousands of people go missing across the world, leaving behind a trail of unanswered questions and heartbroken loved ones. In the United States, where going missing voluntarily is legally permissible, this phenomenon takes on a unique significance. When reporting a loved one as unreachable, law enforcement often highlights this possibility in the crucial first few hours, which are vital for any subsequent investigation. Sadly, there is no focused or unanimous effort from governmental or non-governmental authorities to collect and store information in a centralized place where we can crowdsource our efforts to locate missing individuals.


This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a collaborative platform where we can gather and share information about missing persons. By harnessing the power of crowdsourcing, we can collectively contribute our knowledge, insights, and any available details that could aid in the search for those who have gone missing.


## Goals
1. *Centralize Information:* Provide a single, accessible repository for data on missing persons, including their identities, last known locations, physical descriptions, and any other relevant details.
2. *Facilitate Collaboration:* Enable users to contribute corrections, updates, and new information about missing individuals, fostering a collaborative effort to keep the data as accurate and up-to-date as possible.
3. *Raise Awareness:* Increase public awareness about the issue of missing persons and the importance of collective action in locating and reuniting them with their loved ones.
4. *Empower Communities:* Empower communities to take an active role in the search for missing individuals by providing them with a platform to share information and coordinate efforts.


## Contributing
We welcome and encourage contributions from anyone who wishes to participate in this important cause. Whether you have information about a missing person, suggestions for improving the project, or technical expertise to offer, your contributions are invaluable.
**Please contribute by submitting your updates to the *missing_persons_clean.csv* file. Only submissions that include valid resource links for verification will be merged.**


## Interactive Map
At the heart of this project is an interactive map that visualizes the locations and key details of missing persons. This map is not just a data visualization tool; it's a window into the stories and lives behind each missing person, inviting us to reflect on the philosophical depths of individual autonomy, self-determination, and the pursuit of an authentic existence.

Please explore the interactive map to contribute your insights, and join us in this thought-provoking exploration of the philosophical dimensions surrounding missing persons.

Together, we can make a difference in the lives of those who have gone missing and their loved ones. Let's find the missing, one step at a time.
